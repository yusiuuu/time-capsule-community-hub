# time-capsule-community-hub
AI-driven web app for community waste exchange with upcycling and need prediction
## Notes
- Webpack Dev Server deprecation warnings (`onAfterSetupMiddleware`, `onBeforeSetupMiddleware`) appear due to `react-scripts` v5.0.1. These are harmless for development and will be addressed in production builds.
## Known Issuesâ€¦
- Some dev dependencies (e.g., react-scripts) have high vulnerabilities. These are inherited from Create React App and do not impact production builds.
